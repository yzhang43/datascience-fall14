# Lab 1

---

The goal of Lab 1 is to learn to use the different machine learning algorithms available in the Scikit-Learn Python library.

Scikit-Learn is not installed on the virtual image provided to you. Run the following command in the terminal to install it:

`pip install -U numpy scipy scikit-learn`

Instructions to getting started with Scikit-Learn as well as the assignment questions are both in: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/umddb/datascience-fall14/blob/master/lab1/lab1_scikit.ipynb

We will use ELMS for submission. Details on that will be posted here shortly.
